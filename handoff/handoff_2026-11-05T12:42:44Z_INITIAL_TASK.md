# Handoff for Next Agentic Work Session

**Timestamp:** 2026-11-05T12:42:44Z
**Session:** Kilo (kilo-auto/free)
**Working Directory:** `/home/runner/work/Quantitative-Trading-Public-Research-Prompted/Quantitative-Trading-Public-Research-Prompted`
**Branch/HEAD:** `main` / `30fd8ffca22a19e7621688064035a8a8d3ba6de5` ("chore(kilo): checkpoint agent session")

## Initial Task (clear)

**No new research task is in progress.** The repository is in a **closed / conformance** state.

- Research phase complete (E001–E088). Validated surviving strategies and full history are documented in `ledger/RESEARCH_LEDGER.md` (last entry E088).
- **Do not** re-run or re-open the "cost sensitivity on `large_liquid`" task — already complete as **E005** with committed artifact `experiments/cost_sensitivity.json` (SHA-pinned in `ledger/golden_baseline.json`).
- **Next session action:** Await explicit user instruction. If asked to perform maintenance, verify integrity first; if asked to start new research, pre-register it as the next experiment (E089+), follow `AGENTS.md` conventions, use `SEED=42`, respect golden/baseline guards, and record results honestly in the ledger.
- **Guardrail:** Do not run verification, modify `experiments/*.json` goldens, re-pin baselines, or commit unless explicitly requested.

## Current State (verified at 2026-11-05T12:42:44Z)

- `git status --short` empty; working tree clean.
- `.verify_snapshot/` absent → no interrupted verification run to recover.
- Guards present: `scripts/check_goldens_clean.py`, `scripts/check_golden_baseline.py`, `scripts/check_data_coverage.py`.
- 138 tracked goldens under `experiments/`; all match HEAD (`git diff --stat HEAD -- experiments/` empty).
- 0 broken symlinks (`find . -type l -xtype l`).
- Handoff pointers refreshed to this file.

## Verification Commands (only if explicitly requested)

```bash
SEED=42 bash scripts/check.sh
SEED=42 python3 run_all_verification.py
SEED=42 python3 run_all_verification.py --extended
SEED=42 python3 run_all_verification.py --full
SEED=42 python3 run_all_verification.py --restore-only
SEED=42 python3 verify_convention_robustness.py
```

If interrupted: `SEED=42 python3 run_all_verification.py --restore-only` (or restore pinned goldens as documented in `AGENTS.md`).

## Key References

- `AGENTS.md` — commands, conventions, baseline integrity, optimizer determinism
- `ledger/RESEARCH_LEDGER.md` — full history (E001–E088); E005 = cost sensitivity
- `ledger/PRIORITIZATION.md` — active prioritization (v1.2.5)
- `ledger/golden_baseline.json` / `ledger/data_baseline.json` — pinned fingerprints
- `experiments/cost_sensitivity.json` — committed cost-sweep artifact

## Constraints

- Do not move goalposts post-hoc; record negatives honestly.
- Do not modify `experiments/*.json` goldens unintentionally.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Use `SEED=42` and offline mode where applicable.
- CI workflow cannot be created by automated agents — maintainer must copy `.github/workflow-templates/verification-gate.yml` into `.github/workflows/` via GitHub UI.
