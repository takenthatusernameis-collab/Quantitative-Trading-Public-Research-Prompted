## E001 - Bootstrap Infrastructure & Baseline Strategy Sweep [Completed 2026-10-10]

- **Status**: Completed
- **Source**: Repository was empty (PROMPT.MD + CI workflow only). No prior experiments.
- **Hypothesis**: A minimal, bias-aware backtesting pipeline can be built from free public
  data (yfinance) and used to falsify classic factor anomalies in a walk-forward setting.
- **Data**: 10 US sector/market ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM, VOO, VGT, XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI),
  2014-01-01 to 2026-10-09, daily, auto-adjusted. Benchmark: SPY.
- **Design**: Long-only, top-quintile equal-weight, executed at next-day open,
  tc=0.05% + slippage=0.02%. Walk-forward: 504-day train / 63-day test / 63-day step.
  42 OOS folds. No parameter optimization; fixed literature-standard parameters.
- **Result** (see `experiments/validation_summary.json`):

| Strategy | OOS Sharpe | z vs Placebo | Positive Folds |
|---|---|---|---|
| reversal (12-month) | 1.669 | 16.97 | 32/42 |
| low_vol | 1.467 | 16.18 | 31/42 |
| value | 1.039 | 14.87 | 23/42 |
| momentum_6m | 1.033 | 15.15 | 28/42 |
| quality (low-vol+mom) | 1.037 | — | 28/42 |
| short_reversal | 0.856 | 13.86 | 27/42 |
| momentum (12m) | 0.718 | 12.81 | 27/42 |
| mean_reversion_5 | 0.049 | 9.75 | 22/42 |
| **random (placebo, n=50)** | **-0.656** | — | 0/50 |

- **Validation**:
  - Placebo null distribution built (50 random sims): mean Sharpe **-0.656**, std 0.117.
    Costs destroy noise — a real falsification check.
  - All real strategies clear placebo with z > 9, well beyond 1.96.
  - Walk-forward with no leakage between folds; signals use only lagged data.
  - No look-ahead: weights shifted to next-day open execution.
- **Findings that survived**:
  - Long-term reversal (De Bondt-Thaler, 12-month) is the strongest OOS signal in this universe.
  - Low-vol anomaly (Ang et al. 2006/2008) is robust and cost-resistant.
  - Short-horizon (5-day) mean reversion is weak — consistent with noise-floor expectations.
- **Findings that failed / caveats**:
  - Single data source (yfinance), ETF universe only — not representative cross-section.
  - `auto_adjust=True` merges OHLC adjustments; open-price execution is approximate.
  - No parameter optimization; all signals use fixed parameters.
  - Not independently validated against alternative data or brokers.
- **Decision**: Pipeline is validated and ready for deeper research. Next: test on a
  broader universe (individual equities), add cost sensitivity, and explore
  cross-sectional momentum with industry-standard specifications.

## E002 - Prioritization Procedure v1.0 [Completed 2026-10-10]

- **Status**: Established
- **Rationale**: Repository was empty; needed an explicit, auditable ranking method
  to avoid ad-hoc source selection.
- **Procedure**: 9 weighted criteria (see `ledger/PRIORITIZATION.md`), source priority
  order matching the mission's 5-tier list.
- **Expected benefit**: Transparent, reproducible ranking; track which sources yield
  reproducible discoveries.
- **Evaluation**: Compare strategy hit-rate and OOS Sharpe against random baseline
  over the next 10 experiments; adjust weights if criteria mispredict.

# Handoff for Next Agent

## Most Valuable Next Task

**Extend the universe from 10 sector ETFs to a broad liquid equity universe
(e.g., top ~100 US large-caps by liquidity) and re-validate the top strategies.**

### Rationale

- Current results are **ETF-only** (10 names). Sector ETFs are highly correlated,
  giving a weak cross-section. Individual equities offer richer cross-sectional
  variation and are where most factor anomalies are documented.
- The top strategies (reversal, low_vol, momentum_6m, value) all show strong OOS
  z-scores vs placebo, but this has not been tested on a representative equity universe.
- This is the cheapest high-information experiment: reuse the existing pipeline
  (`src/batch_run.py`, `src/validate.py`) with a new `UNIVERSE` list.

### Prerequisites

- Existing code is complete and validated: `src/data.py`, `src/backtest.py`,
  `src/strategies.py`, `src/run_experiment.py`, `src/batch_run.py`, `src/validate.py`.
- Data pipeline caches to `data/*.parquet`; reuses downloads.
- Placebo baseline already built (`src/validation.py::placebo_distribution`).

### Concrete Completion Criteria

1. Define a new universe of ~50-100 liquid US equities (e.g., Dow 30 + S&P 100
   mega-caps, or a liquidity-filtered list). Add it to `UNIVERSES` in `run_experiment.py`.
2. Re-run `src/batch_run.py` on the new universe; capture `experiments/summary.json`.
3. Re-run `src/validate.py` for placebo comparison and z-scores.
4. Record findings in `ledger/RESEARCH_LEDGER.md` as a new experiment entry
   (include negatives, e.g., strategies that fail on the broader universe).
5. Update `README.md` with the new results.

### Blockers / Risks

- yfinance rate limits on large universes; consider caching and staggering downloads.
- Individual equities have higher idiosyncratic risk; diversification assumptions
  (top-quintile equal-weight) may need revisiting.
- Survivorship: yfinance backfill may include delisted names inconsistently;
  note this in the ledger.

### Infrastructure Status

- **Working**: data pipeline, walk-forward backtest, metrics, placebo validation.
- **Known limitations**: `auto_adjust=True` merges OHLC adjustments (open execution
  approximate); no parameter optimization; single data source.
